# wad_8D_group_project

## Please develop card app in the dev branch, and merge it to the main branch after test passes

TO-DO:
```
Forms: FlashCardForm, CommentForm
HTML Templates: account, search, test, edit, likely more
Views: One for each remaining template
CSS: Bootstrap stuff for each template, in styles.css or other extra .css files
Javascript: More freeform, but some ideas: 
  - In show_card swap question text with answer text on click (maybe some animation too)
  - Add shadow/outline when hovering over flash card sets
  - Could use jQuery to implement these
```
